  "input: \"What does it mean to have a mental illness?\"",
  "output: \"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\"",
  "input: \"What are some of the warning signs of mental illness?\"",
  "output: \"Symptoms of mental health disorders vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. The following is a list of general symptoms that may suggest a mental health disorder, particularly when multiple symptoms are expressed at once.  In adults: \n* Confused thinking\n* Long-lasting sadness or irritability\n* Extreme highs and lows in mood\n* Excessive fear, worrying, or anxiety\n* Social withdrawal\n* Dramatic changes in eating or sleeping habits\n*Strong feelings of anger\n* Delusions or hallucinations \n* Increasing inability to cope with daily problems and activities\n* Thoughts of suicide\n* Denial of obvious problems\n* Many unexplained physical problems\n* Abuse of drugs and/or alcohol\n* Changes in sleeping and/or eating habits             * *Defying authority, skipping school, stealing, or damaging property\n* Intense fear of gaining weight\n* Long-lasting negative mood, often along with poor appetite and thoughts of death\n* Frequent outbursts of anger\n In younger children:\n*Changes in school performance\n* Poor grades despite strong efforts \n* Excessive worrying or anxiety\n* Hyperactivity\n* Persistent nightmares\n* Persistent disobedience and/or aggressive behavior\n* Frequent temper tantrums\"",
  "input: \"Can people with mental illness recover?\"",
  "output: \"When healing from mental illness, early identification and treatment are of vital importance. Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process. Many people with mental illnesses who are diagnosed and treated respond well, although some might experience a return of symptoms. Even in such cases, with careful monitoring and management of the disorder, it is still quite possible to live a fulfilled and productive life.\"",

  "output: \"Although ZenTherabot  cannot substitute for professional advice, we encourage those with symptoms to talk to their friends and family members and seek the counsel of a mental health professional. The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery. If you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal.

  "output: \"A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone.\"",
